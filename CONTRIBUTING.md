# Contibuting to Cofoundry

## Feedback

Content management systems are by their nature very broad in scope and need to satisfy a large variation of use-cases.  Often when building a new feature the tricky part isn't so much the programming, it is figuring out how the feature should work, discovering the use-cases it needs to satisfy and working out how we make a feature both user-friendly and developer-friendly.

Your feedback is really important in helping us shape Cofoundry and focus on building the right tools in the best way possible.

- Found a bugs or have feature suggestions? Please [add an issue](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/cofoundry/issues) with as much detail as possible

## Code Contributions and PRs

Cofoundry is developed by a small team at [Uber Digital](https://www.uberdigital.com). We currently do not have the resources to review and accept code contributions or put in place the legal framework that would allow us to integrate contributed code.

We hope that in time as Cofoundry becomes more popular we will be able to invest in this area and start accepting code contributions.

Please do not send pull requests. If you are interested in contributing code do get in touch so we can start to gauge interest and advise on alternative ways to contribute.

## Plugin Development

Cofoundry is highly extensible and has a modular architecture that allows developers to build plugins that seamlessly integrate via a simple NuGet install. 

We use this architecture to create our own plugins, but this area is not yet extensively documented. The current documentation is [here](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/cofoundry/wiki/Creating-a-Plugin).

If you are interested in creating your own plugin, please do get in touch with us and we'll be happy to assist.
